        <p class="mb-2">
          Today is your birthday—the most special and awaited day for me. On this beautiful occasion, I pray that God showers you with endless blessings, love, and happiness. My dear bacchi, even though we may not be physically close today, you are always nestled deep in my heart. ❤️
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          You are the brightest star in my universe, the most adorable, loving, and precious girl I’ve ever known. Being with you, loving you, and calling you mine is the greatest gift life has given me. I want nothing more than to hold your hand and walk this journey of life with you—forever and always. 💞
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          You are incredibly special to me, and today is your day—so smile more, laugh louder, eat your favorite food, and rest well. I may not be beside you in person, but I am always with you in spirit, watching over you with love and care. 💫
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Please never forget—no matter what life throws our way, I will never leave your side. Proposing to you, making you my girlfriend, and now sharing this bond as your partner is the best decision of my life, one I will cherish forever. 💍
